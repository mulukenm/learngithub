# Learning Git and Github!

Version control is an essential skill for developers to master, and Git is by far the most popular version control system on the web. This course will be used to install Git and use the fundamental commands needed to work with Git projects: moving files, managing logs, and working with branches. In addition to working with Git, this learning includes how to work with the popular GitHub website to explore existing projects, clone them to your local hard drive, and use them as templates for your new projects.
